# gastrak-data

This is the companion repo for [gastrak](https://github.com/apsun/gastrak)
where I store the contents of my `data/` directory. It primarily serves as
a personal backup; you do not need this repo to run gastrak.

On the off chance that you actually want to use this data, simply clone it
into the gastrak directory under `data/`:

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:apsun/gastrak.git gastrak
cd gastrak
git clone git@github.com:apsun/gastrak-data.git data
```
